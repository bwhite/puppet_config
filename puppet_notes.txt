Puppet Notes
http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet_core_types_cheatsheet.pdf

Install Puppet (https://gist.github.com/7eb466a9e9168c10e3b4) (replace ln.dappervision.com with the server)
bash puppet_setup.py

To run the agent command manually run (replace puppet_server with the server)
sudo puppet agent -t --server puppet_server --debug


Debugging Tips
- For certificate issues, the simplest solution is to
1. Delete /etc/puppet/ssl on the clients and server
2. Kill the puppet process on the server (sudo killall -9 puppet)
3. Start the puppet server
3. Run "sudo puppet cert list" on the server to remake its certificate
4. Rerun the puppet agent command on the clients (they will be auto-signed)
