python genconfig.py master slave0 slave1 ...
sudo rsync -av puppet /etc/
scp puppet/puppet_client_setup.sh machine:
ssh machine bash puppet_client_setup.sh


Debugging Tips
- For certificate issues, the simplest solution is to
1. Delete /etc/puppet/ssl on the clients and server
2. Kill the puppet process on the server (sudo killall -9 puppet)
3. Start the puppet server
3. Run "sudo puppet cert list" on the server to remake its certificate
4. Rerun the puppet agent command on the clients (they will be auto-signed)


Tested on
Linode 10.04 (must use 2.6 kernel because of entropy issue)
Linode 11.04 64x (must use 2.6 kernel because of entropy issue)
Linode 11.10 64x
Linode 12.04 64x
